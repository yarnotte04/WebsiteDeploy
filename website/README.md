# Project 1 - IoT4Climate

## Case

Together with 2 fellow students you will develop a startup company IoT4Climate that will devise and offer IoT solutions that can slow down climate change. To develop the one-page website, your colleagues look at you. The website should mention something about climate change itself, about what you develop/offer, a contact form and information about the company.

Take a look at these sites for information:
* [Nasa - Global Climate Change](https://climate.nasa.gov/)
* [Flanders - Annual average temperature](https://www.vmm.be/klimaat/jaargemiddelde-temperatuur)
* [NOAA - Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)

## Structure

1. Create a ROOT folder with corresponding folder structure for this website.
2. Your web page starts with a container that contains the name of your company and your slogan below it.
3. Below you can find a navigation bar that has been created via a list structure. The navigation bar allows you to jump to the different sections of your web page.
4. Now follows some sections, each placed in a container. Each section consists of 1 header, at least 2 paragraphs and 1 or more image(s). The last element of a section is always a link that takes you back to the beginning of the web page.
5. Section 1 tells about your company, you as founders and most importantly what your mission is.
6. Section 2 shows what climate change is and what the consequences will be.
7. Section 3 gives at least 3 examples of how you will use IoT to combat climate change.
8. Section 4 contains a contact form and contact details.
9. The web page closes with a footer section where the copyright information is displayed.

## Styling

1. You don't use bootstrap to get your styling.
2. Give your browser window a color and make sure the body takes up 90% of the screen width, has a color and is central. There is also some space above the body.
3. The entire website has been given a default font and size, the text color has also been set.
4. The first container with the title has an image as the background that takes up the full width of the body. Make sure the letters remain readable. The title and slogan are central to the container.
5. The navigation bar is horizontal, just below the first container and also takes up the full width of the body. Choose appropriate colors and make sure the items change layout when you hover over them.
6. The sections have an alternating background color. The titles have an accent color and the text is somewhat larger. Images are limited in size and have a fine border with rounded corners that is somewhat removed from the image itself.
7. In section 3 you work with 3 columns with the examples.
8. Give the contact section a similar layout to this :

9. The footer is displayed in a different background and text color. The font is also a bit smaller.
